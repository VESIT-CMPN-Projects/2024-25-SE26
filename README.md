These are FrontEnd and backEnd Files....
For Backend...we have used Sqlite3 (gyanMargDB.db is our db name)

For Frontend, simple HTML and CSS is used.

Node Modules and other self deployable items are not pushed into this repository.

You can view the FrontEnd...first page through the github pages.

As the Backend is currently on local pc...you will not get functional website through pages.
